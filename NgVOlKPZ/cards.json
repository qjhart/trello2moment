The Board's responsibilities were to meet semi-annually to consult and to adopt measures to promote the progress of California's viticultural industires. Each year the board would select one person to deliver at least one lecture in each of the State's viticultural districts, imparting instruction in the methods of culture, pruning, fertilizing, fermenting, distilling, raisin drying, etc., and to disseminate useful knowledge relating to viticulture by printed documents or correspondence. The Board's annual reports show early members looking to foreign markets, climates, and geographies to determine what to plant in California. Chardonnay was not listed among the 350 varieties that the Board's first president, Agoston Haraszthy, imported into California in 1961. Haraszthy's son, Arpad Haraszthy, was the first president of the Board of Commissioners.\n\n# Connections\n\n*Led by https://trello.com/c/hCeXR2zR\n *Charles Wetmore was the Secretary of the California Viticultural Commission from 1880 to 1894.\n\n# Links to Learn More\nhttp://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=California.%20Board%20of%20State%20Viticultural%20Commissioners","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5d6eaa741c6c48177073cf78","idList":"5d6eaa741c6c48177073cf7b","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":18,"idAttachmentCover":"5d801307b4588c0a380030df","idLabels":[],"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Board of State Viticultural Commissioners","pos":16383.75,"shortLink":"I3IabGsw","isTemplate":false,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":0,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/I3IabGsw","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/I3IabGsw/18-board-of-state-viticultural-commissioners","cover":{"idAttachment":"5d801307b4588c0a380030df","color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"light"}},{"id":"5dae33db0e284c724a942d81","checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"dateLastActivity":"2019-10-23T23:54:21.097Z","desc":"# Location\n\nLivermore, Napa, Sonoma\n\n# When\n\n1850/1920\n\n# Description\n\nBefore Prohibition California's most popular white wines were made from grapes like Green Hungarian, Burger, Sylvaner, Tokay, and Riesling.

While Schoonmaker was selling Wente Chardonnay on the East Coast, Wente was also using varietal labelling for their wines distributed on the West Coast. Like Schoonmaker, Ernest Wente believes that the long-term success for the winery was rooted in consumer education, and that varietal labelling was one step in that process.

Stony Hill was the first new post-Prohibition winery in Napa, and it was dedicated entirely to white wines.\n\n(Around the same time, Jack Taylor began planting Chard in his Mayacamas Vineyard. Mayacamas and Stony Hill were the first to knowingly establish Chard in Napa Valley)\n\n1953\nStony Hill released first Chard wine from their vineyard\n\nIn 1946, Fred and Eleanor McCrea planted their Stony Hill vineyard on Spring Mountain with chardonnay budwood from Wente's Livermore vineyard. Their winery was bonded in 1947. The McCreas used a minimalist approach to winemaking: no malolactic fermentatino, no battonage, and only old neutral oak, an approach that Mike Chelini, the winemaker whom son Peter McCrea hired to follow Fred, carried on. In 1954 when Stony Hill winery released its first ever vintage – a 1952 Chardonnay costing $21.69 a 12-pack incl P&P – there were only around 200 acres of Chardonnay in California. The McCreas implemented the first mailing list for direct wine sales that shaped much of California’s premium wine distribution. Every single bottle of Stony Hill from the first vintage was sold mail order.\n\nThe McCreas were considered oddballs for planting Chardonnay. UC Davis advised them to plant Riesling and Pinot Blanc (?) in case the Chard didn't work out. This is in part because after Prohibition there was no real market for dry wines, or the type of Burgundy-style wines the McCreas wanted to make.\n\n# Connections\n\n*https://ohc-search.lib.berkeley.edu/catalog/MASTER_686\n\n# Links to Learn More\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5d6eaa741c6c48177073cf78","idList":"5d9e7a4d996b8f0ce37ed5ce","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":5,"idAttachmentCover":"5d815436dda43b7be6345c4f","idLabels":[],"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Stony Hill","pos":327679,"shortLink":"hPI526VA","isTemplate":false,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":0,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/hPI526VA","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/hPI526VA/5-stony-hill","cover":{"idAttachment":"5d815436dda43b7be6345c4f","color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"light"}},{"id":"5d6eb6cd5c4bb756b0584f87","checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"dateLastActivity":"2019-10-10T17:09:00.052Z","desc":"# Location\n- Sonoma, California\n- 38.31334, -122.46241\n\n# When\n- 1953/Present\n\n# Description\nEstablished in 1940 by James Zellerbach, a paper-company executive, U.S. ambassador, to Italy, and lover of Romanee-Saint-Vivant. \n\nHe also felt French oak, then unheard of in California, was the best thing to age wine in, and that revolutionized the aging of fine wine in the state.\n\nHanzell currently lays claim to the oldest Chardonnay clones.\n\nFirst winery to use temperature-controlled tanks for fermentation, the result of a collaboration between Brad Webb and a stainless steel manufacturer.

Within each category, an elite of top quality varieties exists, after which come a number of subsidiary grapes...[that] can be extremely useful for blending components\" \nChard is \"one of the two classic varieties used in Champagne, where it fetches a premium over Pinot Noir. Chardonnay is also the most successful brut style variety worldwide, adapting to a greater range of climates, soils and locations than any other grape.  It has the greatest tendency to go toasty if aged after disgorgement, but can also develop finer, creamy, biscuity nuances, especially when from top growths of the Cote des Blancs in Champagne\"\n\nThis is, for instance, in contrast with Chenin Blanc, whose \"naturally high acidity level is ideal for sparkling wine, but its aromatic qualities are too assertive, and this fights against the subtle effects of autolysis* and prevents the development of mellow, bottle aromas of any true finesse\" (p. 315)\n*Autolysis (p. 321): The enzymatic breakdown of yeast cells...[which] creates the inimitable \"champagney\" character, providing the potential for complexity\"\n\np 20: Chard's neutrality is recognized as an asset in making Champagne:\n\"Grape varieties must be relatively neutral for a classic brut-style sparkling wine, although more aromatic varieties are suited to sweeter styles. Chardonnay and [its parent], Pinot Noir are the greatest exponents of the brut style, and Chardonnay is often the most sucessful in regions that are least suited climatically to sparkling wine production\".\n\nMontrachet (Burgundy white)- from cote d’or, slightly warmer, produces fully ripe “classic ideal of the ...full bodied richness” expression of chard (WInes of CA, Balzer 1978)\nMeursault (Burgundy white)\nPouilly-Fuisse\n\nCalifornia\n\nhttp://fps.ucdavis.edu/grapebook/winebook.cfm?chap=Chardonnay\n“The familiar \"California style\" Chardonnay wine - ripe, buttery, and \"oakey\" - was developed with use of riper grapes, acid-lowering malolactic fermentation and aging in oak barrels.\n\n“It had a reputation [in the 60’s and 70’s] for being a difficult grape to grow and a sporadic producer, so it made sense to them to plant in warmer climates to ensure ripening.” Resulted in huge crops of ultraripe grapes good for “blockbuster C styles of the 1970’s”.

Even experience tasters cannot detect any mark of varietal distinctiveness in the usual wines of high acidity.  Howerver, it is exactly this delicacy and cleanness of taste that makes the variety an excellent base for champagne and a delight to the connoisseur.  It is the moment of picking...that marks the difference between the Chardonnays of Chablis and Champagne and the mellow Montrachet. ” (Olmo, in Balzer, p. 40-41)\n\nAND YET:\n‘To the lover of Chardonnay wines, the grape variety announces itself as unmistakably as the theme of Beethoven’s fifth symphony.

In Muscatine; Amerine; Thompson (Eds). 1984. Book of California Wine. \n\nIf fine Chardonnay is as unmistakable as Beethoven, still there are many variations on the theme. Given that the wine is soundly made, the variables are great, and many of them lead naturally to experimentation by an adventurous vintner.  Every step from vine training through bottling opens avenues that lead to individual styles in a wine that responds gracefully to many approaches.” Mcrea, Eleanor.  Chardonnay.

Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources) ; 3419). Oakland, Calif.: University of California, Agriculture and Natural Resources. (p. 45): \"one of the leading white grape varieties in the world for production of high-quality white wines. The variety probably originated in the Burgundy region of France. The name \"Chardonnay\" has been linked to a village in the Macon region and is derived from Cardonnacum, which means \"a place of thistles.\"  \n\nIdentification: \n\n“During the last decade or so, DNA marker technology (also known as DNA fingerprinting) has largely replaced traditional ampelography as a means of identifying grape vines. In traditional ampelography [\"the art of identifying grape varieties by observation of leaf and fruit characteristics (Bettiga, 2003)\"], the evaluation of some characteristics is subjective, and thus experts can and do differ.”\n\nHowever, the ability to identify varieties in real time assists vineyard consultants in making recommendations and verifying the identity of material received from nurseries. \"ampelography is still part of the viticulture program at UC Davis and Montpellier, as well as other academic institutions.\" \n\"“It takes many years of practice to become proficient at ampelography, but all viticulturists and enologists greatly benefit from being aware of the leaf, cluster, and berry characteristics that distinguish varieties,” notes UC Davis viticulture professor Dr. Andy Walker, who teaches ampelography at the university.\"  \" “Ampelography makes an intimate connection to the vine. It’s like being introduced to the author of a book, and there’s something really personal about that. You’re going to the source.”\n https://daily.sevenfifty.com/ampelography-the-art-of-vine-identification/\n\n\"The most important thing to look at when trying to identify a grape vine is the growing tip, if there is one. “That’s the first thing I look for,” Morton explains. “Is it fuzzy? Is it hairless? Is it shiny? Is it covered in white cottony hair? The growing tip hairiness gets you somewhere as far as a starting place.” https://daily.sevenfifty.com/ampelography-the-art-of-vine-identification/\n\nThe new shoots of Chardonnay are downy white, and the young leaves are yellow-green with \"bronze-red tinges\". (Bettiga, 2003)\n\n\"Then, she observes the general leaf shape. “Does it have lobes or does it look like a shield? Does it have a lot of indentations or is it solid? Is the leaf thin or thick?...Third on the list of important attributes is the petiolar sinus, the empty space surrounding the stem of the leaf. Some sinuses are wide open, while others are so narrow they’re hardly noticeable.\" https://daily.sevenfifty.com/ampelography-the-art-of-vine-identification/\n\n\"Chardonnay has a shield-shaped leaf, with sawblade-like teeth and an open petiolar sinus bordered by “naked” veins. Its young shoots have red nodes, a particularly distinctive marker.\" \n\nBears fruit in small to medium sized clusters (typically larger in California than in France), cylindrical in shape, and often winged to double in larger clones.  The berries are small, and yellow to amber when ripe. \n\nVines grow with weak to moderate vigor, relative to other varieties. Chardonnay is most vigorous on \"Deep valley bottom soils\" with ample moisture. Chardonnay has no known incompatibility with any rootstock, and its  establishment can be enhanced with high-vigor rootstocks. Growth and yield are reduced in windy, cooler, coastal areas. \n \"The most distinctive [Chardonnay] wines are produced in areas where the grapes can achieve full ripeness and yet maintain moderately high acidity.\" (p. 49)\n\nCharacterized as an early season variety, Chardonnay ripens in late August-early Sept in warmer regions, and mid- to late-Oct in colder areas. It is \"one of the first varieties to begin growth in the spring, which makes vines more susceptible to frost injury\" and loss from bird predation.  \n\nCountries of Origin: France\nSpecies: Vitis vinifera\nPedigree: Pinot noir x Gouais blanc\n\nReferences: Christensen, L et al. 2003.

Noble grape; cross between Pinot Noir and Gouais Blanc (medieval). Produced wines in Macon since Middle Ages\n\nThis trend continued through the 70s when California Ports, Madeiras, and Moscatels evolved into White Zinfandels and wine coolers. Though some records indicate that Chardonnay was present in California during the mid-late 19th century, it had a very limited role. Producers like Stony Hill and Hanzell began to work with the grape with great success in the 50s, but it existed purely on the margin; in 1960 there were only around 150 documented acres of Chardonnay in the state. But its popularity continued to grow at a rapid pace in the 1960s, and after Chateau Montelena's Chardonnay bested some of Burgundy's most iconic wines in the 1976 Judgment of Paris, its subsequent boom was supersonic.\n\nParentage discovered at Davis? Carole Merideth's group produced one study, was there an earlier one?\n\n“Chardonnay is a highly adaptable variety that performs well in many soils and microclimates throughout the world.  Three of CA’s greates C vineyards, Stony Hill, Hanzell and Chalone, are rooted in entirely different environments and soil, and they experience different sun exposures, levels of rainfall, and so on. ..what is clear is that C, with all its vigor, grows better in a cooler climate than a warmer one.  Grapes like Cab Sauv, Zin or even Sauv Blanc like the warmth, but C does not need the heat. ( Balzer, p. 30)\n\n“Chardonnay leaves are uncommonly large and nearly entire (i.e. they have negligible lobing).

A core collection containing ‘Pinot noir’ and ‘Gouais blanc’ will contain the same allelic resources as a larger collection that also includes cultivars that are the progeny of these two” (Bowers et al. 1993, p.1564)\n\n*This is complicated by a 2019 paper from Australia, which suggests difference is relative. \n\nPinot noir: \n\n\"Perhaps the oldest cultivated variety of the genus Vitis.

It is generally very productive, and measures are sometimes taken to reduce yield to improve wine quality.  (Bettiga, 2003)\n\nUsed to make sparkling white wine when harvested at lower sugar levels.  Harvested at higher sugar levels for red table wine, where it is known for its relatively light color, and its aroma and flavor.  Color and flavor are reduced when it is grown in hotter areas (Bettiga, 2003, p. 111 -article by Rhonda J.

It was noted to be less susceptible to frost than some of the earlier and finer varieties, but cultivation was banned in some areas, as would one of its progeny, Melon.  \"Gou\" is a term of derision, and the possible application of this term to name the grape (along with a thin record) make the relationship of this variety to its (often similarly belittled) relatives difficult to untangle.  It is very similar to its progeny, Aligote, with which it shares: \"vigor; great resistance to winter frost; long life; late budding; woolly shoot tip; flat, entire leaves of a bright green covered by a dense, arachnoid tomentum [hair] on the underside.\" Wine from Aligote is considered more refined.  The fruit of Gouais blanc are a translucent yellow, and the juice is acid, flat, and unpleasantly astringent.  It is never used in mono-varietal wine, but blended to add acidity.

Melon is a mid-season variety that recovers well after a spring frost. Has more conical clusters than Chardonnay, still tending toward cylindrical.  The berries are yellow with a white bloom, and contain high levels of tannins in the skins. The petiolar sinus is U-shaped, as it is in Chardonnay, but more closed.  It also differs from Chardonnay in not having \"naked\" veins.  The shoot tips are \"felty cream-yellow\", whereas in Chardonnay they are downy white. (Bettiga, 2003, p. 83)\n\nMelon is an old Burgundian variety, the cultivation of which was banned at various times throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to protect the market for higher value grapes, such as Chardonnay and Pinot.  Growers of Melon responded with measures to conflate the identity of Melon with that of Chardonnay, a confusion that continued in the New World. There is speculation that the name references the resemblance of the vine's round, thick, leaf to that of a melon plant. \"Melon wine is light with little body and, while pleasant, [lacks] exceptional qualities.  In the cooler areas of Anjou, however, Muscadet [a synonym for Melon] yields products that can be superior to Chardonnay and are often sold under the name of Chablis\".

At Foundation Plant Services (FPS), “clone” is the equivalent of a selection.  At the USDA facilities, “clone” is the equivalent of an accession.” (FPS: https://fps.ucdavis.edu/fgrglossary.cfm)\n\nJohn Caldwell, A Concise Guide to Wine Grape  Clones  for Professionals (Napa, Calif.: privately printed, 1995\n \nCLONE . In botany a  clone  is a group of plants descended from a single plant through vegetative reproduction so that all members of the group theoretically have the same genetic constitution. Interest in  clones  is a recent development in California winegrowing. As late as 1974 there was no index reference to the topic in A. J. WINKLER'S universally honored textbook, General Viticulture . Today most of our knowledge of  clones  comes from controlled scientific studies at American and European universities.\n\nEven so, for about 6,000 years men and women have been selecting vines for certain characteristics and then multiplying them with cuttings. Those cuttings were  clones : not themselves truly separate varieties, but rather, strains with distinctive characteristics within varieties, but they all have the same genetic constitution. (For wine grapes, a  clone  is described by viticultural scholars as a distinct subtype within a given variety.) Thus, for example, some Chardonnay  clones  bear large crops, others bear grapes that are strongly flavored but have low yields.\n\nEarly winegrowers in California knew nothing of  clones , but some varieties, such as the Pinot noir, evidenced differences and so were regarded as several varieties, known by different names. In fact, they were all  clones of the one variety. Today there are Chardonnay selections that survived Prohibition as separate  clones  and Californians treat them with reverence. The Wente and Masson  clones  are examples.\n\nClone  diversity has become an important element in modern vineyard management. Winegrowers intending to make estate and single-vineyard wines do well to use several  clones  of a variety in their planting. Clonal selection is also important. A grower looking for large yields to produce fighting varietals will probably not select a  clone  that might be attractive to a producer aiming at a superpremium wine. Today winegrowers in California who are interested in clonal selection are most likely to focus their attention on Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Syrah, Sangiovese, and Merlot.\n\nAndy Walker (pers comm)- olmo developed the idea of clone in viticulture\n\nCertified clone: \nAvailable through the Foundation Plant Service (formerly the Foundation Plant Materials Service), \"certified to be free of virus expression and true to type.\"\n\nmass selection: \"A form of breeding in which individual plants are selected on their individual advantages and the next generation propagated from the aggregate of their seeds\" (Schlegel, R. (2010). Dictionary of plant breeding (2nd ed.). Boca Raton: CRC Press. p.227) \n\nMass selection (Zelma Long, 1994 Focus on Chard)- “often carry the name either from the original vineyard (such as Mt. Eden…) or of the most recent vineyard from which the selection was taken…” (p.129) un-even sampling or introduction of disease from field may make expression of scions different from that of parent population\n\nvariety: \"A plant differing from other members of the species to which it belongs by the possession of some hereditary traits\" (Schlegel, R. (2010). Dictionary of plant breeding (2nd ed.). Boca Raton: CRC Press. p.367)\n\nvarietal (wine): “Beginning in January 1983, the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms require that any wine labeled as a varietal must contain a minimum 75 percent of that variety, a jump of 24 percent from the previous minimum requirement” Mcrea, Eleanor.  Chardonnay. In Muscatine; Amerine; Thompson (Eds). 1984. Book of California Wine. (p.246)\n\n\"Severe virus disease problems in California vineyards during the 1950s spurred UC and USDA scientists to develop methods for grape virus disease detection and disease elimination. A large collection of disease-tested wine, table, raisin and rootstock grape selections was created which became the foundation for the California Grapevine Registration & Certification (R&C) Program. The current Foundation Vineyards of over 100 acres are all established on fumigated soil in isolated locations. Vines are inspected and retested regularly by FPS and CDFA. FPS is the source of all California Registered or Certified grapevines\" Source: https://fps.ucdavis.edu/fgrmain.cfm\n\n“**Minor player into 1968, as Winkler and Amerine start tentatively recomm in some areas\n\"The grape and wine industry showed an increased willingness to experiment with the Chardonnay variety in the 1960's. Davis experts Harold Olmo and Austin Goheen selected and tested promising California clonal material and subjected it to heat treatment to eliminate the viruses that impeded yields. The result was higher-yielding, virus-tested clonal material that produced effectively in various climate zones\" \n\n\"Early 1960s: Shy bearer, difficult to plant and grow, and not recommended by UCD for planting.\nOlmo selected healthy, productive clones (Wente, Martini) -- changed yield from 2 tons per acre to four or five, basis for major market expansion of good quality grapes.\"\nhttp://fps.ucdavis.edu/grapebook/winebook.cfm?chap=Chardonnay\n\nSome of the early named clones are probably better understood as mass selections.  For example, winemakers took cuttings from the plantings of Chardonnay established by Wente, presumably from the best looking canes, and treated them as a homogenous group that came to be known as the \"Wente Clone\".  \n\n\"An early University of California clonal selection effort in the late 1050's by H.P. Olmo identified more productive clones\"   \"Chardonnay FPS selections 04 and 14 were eventually released from the Martini material...[and] are the most widely planted in California.\" Bettiga, L. (2003). Wine grape varieties in California (Publication (University of California (System). Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources) ; 3419). Oakland, Calif.: University of California, Agriculture and Natural Resources. (p. 47).\n\n\"Some confusion remains over the term \"Wente Clone\".  The name has described both an older selection with small clusters that have a high percent of shot berries [a berry that fails to develop to maturity, and often stays green and small] (often called \"Old Wente\") and the more productive heat-treated  selections from FPS that can be traced back to the Wente vineyard.\" Bettiga, L. (2003). Wine grape varieties in California (Publication (University of California (System). Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources) ; 3419). Oakland, Calif.: University of California, Agriculture and Natural Resources. (p. 47).\n\n\"There are also Chardonnay Musque selections such as Rued, See's, Spring Mountain, and Sterling (FPS 79 and 80) that have a slight muscat-like character\". Bettiga, L. (2003). Wine grape varieties in California (Publication (University of California (System). Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources) ; 3419). Oakland, Calif.: University of California, Agriculture and Natural Resources. (p. 47).\n\nJullianne's text: At Tchelistcheff’s urging, Louis M. purchased a 200-acre chunk of the historic Stanly Ranch in Carneros, which he planted to Pinot Noir (using cuttings from Inglenook) and other cool climate varieties (plus a dash of Cabernet). Later on, his son Louis P. embarked on a clonal project with UC Davis professor Dr. Olmo. Ultimately, a particularly favorable Stanly Ranch Pinot Noir vine was isolated and propagated. Today, it is known as the Martini clone, a celebrated American heritage selection. (White, Guildsomm)\n\nWente- (Zelma Long, 1994 Focus on Chard) “characterized by small clusters and uneven berry size...generally carries a leaf roll, although this is not always expressed, has low yield with good plant vigor, and provides a very concentrated, well-structured wine” (p.129)\nSpring Mountain- (Zelma Long, 1994 Focus on Chard) “distinguished by its aromatics...very spicy…” wanted something more structured so only planted a little\n\nMt. Eden- (Zelma Long, 1994 Focus on Chard) similar in style to Spring Mountain, “very structured, deep Chardonnay expression”.  \n\nSee- (Zelma Long, 1994 Focus on Chard) “its primary characteristics are textural...tends to produce a very fine, not heavy, not rustic, not coarse, but very fine, silky texture, iwth a rich feel in the mouth and a more subltel varietal expression” (p.129)\n\nFPS clones 4-27 (p. 128 Focus on Chard 1994)\n\nClone 4- (Zelma Long, 1994 Focus on Chard, p.127) The FPS clone that made Chard econ viable, considered uninteresting now\n(Zelma Long, 1994 Focus on Chard, p.131) See Fig 4 for comparison of mass selections\n\n“The most recent trend in vineyards is to graft a mixture of different clones so that the grapes offer a variety of flavors, not a single, dominant characteristic. The choice of rootstock can also influence grapevine productivity, yield and ultimately quality” (p. 31) - probably (Laube, J. 1990)\nLaube, J. (1990).
